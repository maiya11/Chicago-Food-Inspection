# Chicago-Food-Inspection
In this challenge, you'll use data from the Chicago Department of Public Health to build a model to predict whether a food establishment passed inspection or not.

The purpose of this model is to help inspectors use their time more efficiently by identifying establishments that will likely fail inspection. In other words, this model should be able to predict whether an establishment will fail inspection before the inspector arrives at the establishment.
